# Gunshine.net (2011)
Open source private server for Gunshine.net (2011) written on Node.js

## Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

## Setup
1. Download the repository by zip or type this into the Terminal: `git clone https://github.com/Greedycell/Gunshine.net.git`
2. Go into Command Prompt or Terminal and type `npm install` to build the server.
3. Go into Command Prompt or Terminal and type `node .` to start the server.
4. Now it is finished and you can use my client linked in the releases to connect to your server.

## Note
I'm still working on the client for Gunshine.net but the server does work because I know someone that tested it for me and it works well.
